# KIVA Project
 
This is a project launched at Codecademy and it is a part of Data Scientist Career Path.

In this project I'll visualize insights using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva.

Using Seaborn, I'll explore the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. I'll also visualize the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
